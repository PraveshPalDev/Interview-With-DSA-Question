// 1. What is React Native?
// React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It allows developers to use React along with native platform capabilities to build mobile apps for iOS and Android.

// 2. How does React Native differ from React?
// React is a JavaScript library used for building web interfaces, while React Native is used for building mobile applications using native components.

// 3. What are the core components of React Native?
// Core components include View, Text, Image, ScrollView, TextInput, FlatList, SectionList, etc.

// 4. What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component in React Native?
// Controlled components have their input values controlled by React state. Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally.

// 5. How do you style components in React Native?
// Using the StyleSheet.create method or inline styles with JavaScript objects.

// 6. What is JSX?
// JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows writing HTML elements in JavaScript and placing them in the DOM without using createElement() or appendChild().

// 7. What is the use of Flexbox in React Native?
// Flexbox is used to layout elements in one dimension (row or column). It simplifies aligning elements within a container.

// 8. How do you handle navigation in React Native?
// By using libraries like React Navigation or React Native Navigation.

// 9. What is the difference between React Navigation and React Native Navigation?
// React Navigation is a JavaScript-based navigation library, while React Native Navigation uses native navigation components.

// A bridge is used to enable communication between JavaScript and native modules (Objective-C/Java).

// 11. How do you debug a React Native app?
// Using tools like Flipper, React Developer Tools, Chrome DevTools, or by enabling remote debugging.

// 12. What is the difference between props and state?
// Props are used to pass data to components, whereas state is used to manage internal data of a component.

// 13. How do you make an API call in React Native?
// Using fetch API, axios, or other third-party libraries.

// 14. What is the role of the useEffect hook?
// useEffect allows performing side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in functional components.

// 15. What is the difference between useState and useEffect?

// A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, then returns a new state.

// 25. What are middleware in Redux?
// Middleware provides a way to interact with actions before they reach the reducer, useful for logging or asynchronous calls.

// 26. What is React Context?
// React Context is a way to share values like theme or authentication status across the component tree without prop drilling.

// 27. How do you create a custom hook in React Native?
// By writing a function that uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) and returns values.

// 28. What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?
